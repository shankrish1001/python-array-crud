CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) demo using a JSON array is a great way to understand how to manage a collection of objects without a database. 
All data is stored in memory as a list of JSON objects, and operations are performed directly on this list. 
This is useful for building simple, stateless APIs or for front-end development where data is mocked.
